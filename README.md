# Early-Stroke-Detection-ML

## Project Description

Early stroke detection is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a stroke using healthcare data. The project analyzes various medical and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, smoking status, and glucose levels.
By applying machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier, the system aims to improve early diagnosis and support healthcare professionals in taking preventive measures.

## Objectives

- To analyze healthcare data related to stroke patients
- To preprocess and clean missing values
- To apply machine learning models for prediction
- To evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy
- To improve early detection of stroke risk

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Algorithms
